% \headerwithlabel{Cosmic Dawn Intensity Mapper (CDIM)}{\href{https://github.com/runphilrun/CDIM-design/blob/master/cdim_design.pdf}{github.com/runphilrun/CDIM-design}}{\bf Graduate Paper}
% Contributed to a proposal for a Probe Class (\textasciitilde\$850M) NASA mission for a 1.5 meter space telescope intended to observe near-infrared light from the early universe. Compiled financial, mass, and power budgets for the optics, instruments, cryocooler \& spacecraft. Defined system-level design, generated representative CAD models and figures of the spacecraft.

% \headerwithlabel{1 kW Arcjet Thruster}{\href{https://github.com/RIT-Space-Exploration/msd-P17101/blob/master/p17101.pdf}{github.com/RIT-Space-Exploration/msd-P17101}}{\bf Undergraduate Capstone}
% Developed the concept, system-level design, and nozzle design for a small scale arcjet thruster demonstration. Worked in a multidisciplinary team of mechanical and electrical engineers. Responsible for communication between the team and the customer (RIT Space Exploration). Designed and performed CFD analysis on the thruster nozzle.

% \headerwithlabel{Where U At Plants?~(WUAP) High Altitude Balloon Payload}{\href{https://github.com/RIT-Space-Exploration/hab-cv/}{github.com/RIT-Space-Exploration/hab-cv}}{}
% Where U At Plants? (WUAP) is a high-altitude balloon payload using on-board image processing with a Raspberry Pi 3, Python 3 and OpenCV 3.3 to mask RGB images of the Earth and attempts to mask areas of vegetation using colorspace transformations. WUAP flew as a payload on RIT Space Exploration's HAB4 high altitude balloon mission on April 22, 2018. A \href{https://github.com/RIT-Space-Exploration/hab-cv/blob/master/reports/Project%20Definition%20Document/hab-cv.pdf}{Project Definition Document} and \href{https://github.com/RIT-Space-Exploration/hab-cv/blob/master/reports/HAB4%20Post%20Flight%20Report/report_wuap_postflight-hab4.md}{post-flight report} document the design intent and discuss the results.

% \headerwithlabel{Cryogenic Star Tracking Attitude Regulation System (CSTARS)}{RIT Center for Detectors}{}
% Designed the mechanical model of CSTARS, an experiment endorsed by the New York Space Grant and funded with \$100,000 by NASA's Undergraduate Student Instrument Program. I designed CAD models for the cryogenic thermal regulation system, telescope, and mechanical supports in Solidworks 2015. I was the systems engineer for payload integration with a Black Brant IX at NASA Wallops Flight Facility.

% \headerwithlabel{Machine Learning Hackathon}{Lockheed Martin Space}{}
% Led a team to win a company-wide machine learning hackathon competition. Implemented Expectation Maximization algorithm using K-means in Python3 with sci-kit learn. Presented the project approach and results to a panel of LM Engineering \& Technology upper management. 

% \headerwithlabel{Optical Payload Training Course Project}{Lockheed Martin Space}{}
% Led a multidisciplinary team in a course project to design an optical payload mission concept and instrument. Worked in a multidisciplinary team with subject matter experts in Sunnyvale, CA and Denver, CO. Coordinated team meetings, managed progress and action items. Developed an atmospheric science mission concept and designed the instrument.

% \headerwithlabel{Dragon Capsule Water Sealing}{SpaceX}{}
% Designed and tested retrofits to the Dragon Cargo capsule in order to prevent water ingress on splashdown. Investigated water entry paths, conducted experiments to validate designs, and implemented modifications on flight hardware present on Dragon vehicles since the CRS-7 mission.

% \headerwithlabel{Dragon Capsule Parachute Packing Tool Rework}{SpaceX}{}
% Designed and implemented modifications to the Dragon Cargo parachute packing tool, including working with third party vendors to deliver flight critical components.

% \headerwithlabel{Crew Dragon Weldment Doubler Design}{SpaceX}{}
% Designed and drafted engineering CAD models and drawings for structural components installed on critical load members of a flight vehicle. Design start to installation took 4 days.

% \headerwithlabel{GEnx Flowpath Spacer Inspection Optimization}{GE Aviation}{}
% Optimized parameters for detection of internal wrinkles in composite layups with complex geometry during ultrasonic inspection. Conducted destructive microscopy to validate results and presented findings to principal engineers.

% \headerwithlabel{SPEX Project Definition Document Template}{\small\href{https://github.com/RIT-Space-Exploration/SPEX-Project-Definition-Documents}{github.com/RIT-Space-Exploration/SPEX-Project-Definition-Documents}}{}
% A Project Definition Document (PDD) documents a SPEX project idea and its objectives. This template defines the internal standard of quality for all SPEX PDDs and also serves as a template for other projects to build from. This template was used to define the scope of RIT's payload for the Intercollegiate Rocket Engineering Competition 2018, earning the project a \$1000 grant from Students for the Exploration and Development of Space (SEDS).

% \headerwithlabel{SPEXcast Podcast}{\href{https://blog.spexcast.com/}{blog.spexcast.com}}{}
% I produce, edit, and co-host a space exploration podcast, which is a weekly discussion podcast the science and technology of space exploation. SPEXcast also features interviews with space scientists and industry members, including Tory Bruno, Chris Hadfield, and NASA Scientists.
